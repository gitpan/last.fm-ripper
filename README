last.fm-ripper is a small utility to save the last.fm program to individual
mp3-files including all available id3-tags and the cover art (requires MP3::Tag module).

Requires a valid last.fm login and password (http://www.last.fm/signup.php). 

If you don't like to enter your password on the commandline last.fm-ripper asks
for it (requires Term::ReadPassword not to be echoed to the terminal).

For advanced tagging (track-no., year) an amazon webservices developer token
is required (http://amazon.com/soap).
